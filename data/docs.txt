All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year.
Tear down the wall.
The lunatic is on the grass.
Is there anybody out there?
We don't need no education.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You better run like hell when you meet the Hammer.
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older.
There is no pain, you are receding.
Breathe, breathe in the air.
We're just a million little gods causing rainstorms.
One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces.
The dark side of the moon is all that they will see.
We're just echoes of a distant time.
Us and them, and after all, we're only ordinary men.
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all.
The grass was greener, the light was brighter.
